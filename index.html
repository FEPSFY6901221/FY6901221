This article is an analysis for students and academic staff of the advantages and disadvantages of the use of generative AI
 such as ChatGPT for university assignments. It has been known that in the last few years these software’s can help to assist
 people at university by helping with time management, organisation, learning concepts, explaining complex information, linking
 information, etc. However, the downsides of this is that it can cause cheating and even accusations of plagiarism for innocent
 people who do not plagiarise on assignments while also raising ethical issues such as using information from other people’s work
 without referencing. It also raises the question of the impact on university students and whether learning for them will be the
 same again as doing work independently develops critical thinking, a skill that is already on the decline today.

AI can be nbeneficial to learn new information. For example, it has been use to create programming exercises which include
 answers and has been shown to be in some cases good to use. can generate high quality questions and improve the quality of
 higher education information – this can be useful for students who are struggling or students who have learning disabilities.
 It can also lessen hours spent going over trying to understand content or going to a tutor and this better understanding in
 content improves the quality of work of a student – this is my opinion- which can help people und. Lecturers recognise that
 it can be a ‘study tool’ to assist students in the learning process. However the disadvantages of this kind of help is that
 it can cause misinformation and often create issues with copyright and referencing. Chatgpt and AI can create images and art
 however this can pose problems such as plagiarism, as it uses past data and often steal other peoples work. ChatGPT has multilingual
 support which means that it doesn’t only benefit wealthier countries and means that there is access across different countries
 and more university stuents will benefit from its use. However chatgpt has many weaknesses. People are often over relying on ai
 which reduces inepent an critical thinking skills. It can sometimes have incorrect information which can have the opposite effect
 of being a stuy ai for uni assignments, it doesn’t show all sides of a argument and may make people narrow minded and can cause
 acaemic misconduct hearings.
Chatgpt can cause innoncent people to be accused of plagiarism and make it difficult for acameic staff to decided whether a
 stuent has actually cheated or not. This also affects autistic stuents as some write in a formulaic way, leading to innocent people to be penalised.
Other software such as Grammarly are beneficial for people who struggle with writing but can rob people of improving their learning style.
Generative ai can make doing tasks faster and easier but is limited as it is not human. Furthermore, ai is not designed for
 course specific curriculum’s and human resources are better. There are privacy issues with ai (gov website). 

Chatgpt/ai can help poorer stuents who may not have access to expensive tutors or private schools. People who
 struggle with organisation and task management may use it.
A solution to this problem is that univerisities should tlalk to stuents about how to better use ai.
